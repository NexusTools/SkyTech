SkyTech
=======

SkyTech is a mod with two primary parts: a skyblock world type, and an additional ic2 machine called replicator.



####The Replicator
The replicator is an [ic2](http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=9843) compatible machine that uses EU (energy units) to create items that generate in the non-skyblock world, based on the rarity of each item.




####SkyBlock
The skyblock world type is made in honor of the early skyblock maps, players start out on a very small block of dirt with a tree and a chest of goodies, and slowly expand outward. Each player is given their own skyblock generated a set distance from another skyblock, but also have the ability to join other blocks if the owner should accept. There is a small set of commands available to do this.
